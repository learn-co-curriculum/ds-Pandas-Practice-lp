## Teacher Notes

## Summary

This is a set of useful practice exercises for students to test their Pandas knowledge of filtering datasets. Problems also require students to create new features and clean the dataset. 


## Learning Goals
* Remove null values from a Pandas DataFrame
* Remove trailing whitespace from strings stored in cells
* Perform complex filtering on Pandas DataFrames to answer business questions

## Prerequisite Knowledge

Students should already have a solid understanding of pandas including, filtering, creating new features and using built in methods.

## Agenda

* Have students work independently or in pairs on the problem. Students may be given these problems ahead of time for a flipped classroom.
* Review problem exercises one by one. 
	* For question 2, prompt students for how they could clean this or other columns in generl (For example df.col = df.col.map(lamda x: x.strip()))
	* For question 3, be sure to take note of the need to combine both & and | and the need to use careful parentheses to seperate clauses.
	* For question 4, review different approaches for how to combine these lists.
